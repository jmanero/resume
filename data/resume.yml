introduction: >-
  <p>I seek a role on a focused team of engineers at a small, driven company solving difficult
  problems, where my work will have a meaningful impact upon the company and its customers.</p>
  <p>I specialize in the design and implementation of scalable distributed platforms for hosted
  services, on both cloud and datacenter infrastructure. I've designed systems to operate in
  potentially hostile environments with low availability, and written software to manage
  thousands of production resources on Amazon Web Services.</p>

history:
  - name: Rapid7, Inc.
    location: Cambridge, MA
    title: Senior Software Engineer, Platform Delivery
    date: August 2014 - February 2017
    description: >-
      Responsible for design, development, and maintenance of automated image building,
      infrastructure management tools, and configuration management tolls for thousands of
      virtual machines, databases, and networking resources running on Amazon Web Services.

      - name: Spectre Project
        description: >-
          Started the Spectre project to solve problems common to most distributed network services
          using HTTP as their transport. The project aims to provide distributed discovery, dynamic configuration,
          key and secret management, and role-based access control through a set of easily
          consumed HTTP APIs served locally by on-host agents, and a set of central services to
          coordinate discovery, identity management, and policy management. The project is open-source
          with details available at <a target="_blank" href="https://volcano-lair.github.io/">https://volcano-lair.github.io/</a>.
          Several components, including the Consul and Vault Hashicorp projects, and
          <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/rapid7/propsd">Propsd</a>.
      - name: Monitoring and Alerting
        description: >-
          Drove the adoption of DataDog and PagerDuty for monitoring and alerting
          across Rapid7's production infrastructure. This replaced an ad-hoc collection
          of scripts reporting to Amazon CloudWatch and inconsistent alerting via SMS and email
          with an agent deployed to all hosts and an on-call rotation policy that continues
          to serve as the model for the rest of Rapid7's engineering organization.
      - name: CloudFormation Automation
        description: >-
          Developed <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/rapid7/convection">convection</a> to
          provide a definition language and multi-stack orchestration for Amazon CloudFormation.
          Among other features, it provided the ability to dynamically reference identifiers
          across stacks several years before Amazon released a similar feature natively
          in the CloudFormation API. Convection is actively used and developed at Rapid7
          to manage hundreds of stacks across dozens of AWS accounts and regions.
      - name: Image Building CI
        description: >-
          Replaced a home-grown Amazon Machine Image building platform of shell scripts and
          <code>chef-ec2</code> with <code>Packer</code>, <code>chef-solo</code>, and
          <code>Berkshelf</code>, then developed a configuration framework,
          <a target="_blank" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/rapid7/builderator">builderator</a>, to automatically
          generate <code>packer.json</code>, <code>Berksfile</code>, and <code>Vagrantfile</code>s
          from a set of configuration files in the build's repository, on the build host, and from other
          repositories. This allows common configurations for various types of builds to be
          consolidated and managed in central repositories, and for build CIs and workstations'
          local configurations to be defined in one file on the respective host.

  - name: Dyn, Inc.
    location: Manchester, NH
    title: Software Engineer
    description: >-
      Worked on several teams supporting the DynECT Enterprise DNS platform.
    sections:
      - name: Automation Team
        date: June 3013 - August 2014
        description: >-
          Designed and implemented a DNS authoritative platform to run on leased infrastructure
          in China. System was managed entirely by Chef, including secure TSIG key generation and
          distribution across sites, LVS load-balancing, and virtual IP addressing for direct-response
          routing. As of March 2017, the proof-of-concept deployment is still serving DNS for a major
          hosting provider in China.
      - name: DNS Performance and Optimization Team
        date: June 2012 - June 2013
        description: >-
          Worked with a team of six to identify and repair faults in and improve the performance of
          systems that comprise the DynECT DNS platform.
      - name: Internship
        date: Summer 2011
        description: >-
          Responsible for development and load testing of a replacement HTTP-redirect service
          for DynDNS. Work including development of a Perl interface to export redirect mappings
          from the legacy service, and a NodeJS server to handle HTTP requests. After load-testing and
          tuning, the new service sustained 10,000 connection/second loads on BSD test platforms.
          Gained experience in professional software development, source control management, and documentation.

        description: >-
          Team of three Electrical and Computer Engineering students created a distributed control plane
          for multiple energy source heating systems. Platform ran on Linux, using HTTP to read and manage
          embedded sensors and controls. Report is available at
